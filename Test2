#Test 2 initiated 17APR2017
##There is something essential I am not getting about the interplay of Git & GitHub.
##I am making this file in the 'konichi-wa' repository to try and help me figure stuff out.
##Stuff like:
* Practicing Markdown
* Getting the repo to the local machine.
* Updating repo content on the local machine.
* Getting that content back to the GitHub repo.
#That's all for now.
